"""Regression test for #82874: MCP shutdown must not block the event loop.

shutdown_mcp_servers() blocks on future.result(timeout=15) internally. When
called synchronously from inside the asyncio loop (the SIGTERM teardown paths
in start_gateway), it freezes the loop for up to 15 s and can cause the
gateway to be SIGKILLed by a supervisor whose kill grace is shorter.

The fix routes the two synchronous call sites in ``start_gateway`` through
``await loop.run_in_executor(None, shutdown_mcp_servers)`` — the same pattern
the /mcp reload path already used. These tests assert the two behaviours that
matter:

1. The patched call sites actually use run_in_executor (source-level guard).
2. A blocking shutdown dispatched through an executor does not freeze the
   event loop (behavioural guard: concurrent coroutines keep making
   progress).
